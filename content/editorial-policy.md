At **WriTrack**, trust is our most valuable asset. Our editorial process is designed to ensure accuracy, objectivity, and value for our readers in the financial sector.

## 1. Fact-Checking & Sourcing
*   **Primary Sources:** We prioritize data from primary sources such as SEC filings (10-K, 10-Q), Federal Reserve releases, Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS), and official company press releases.
*   **Verification:** All financial figures (P/E ratios, dividend yields, market cap) are verified against reliable market data providers before publication.

## 2. Conflict of Interest & Disclosures
We maintain a strict separation between our editorial team and our business operations.
*   **Trading Restrictions:** Our writers are required to disclose if they hold a position in any security they cover in an article.
*   **No Insider Trading:** WriTrack has a zero-tolerance policy regarding the use of non-public information for personal gain.
*   **No Pay-for-Play:** We do not accept payment from public companies in exchange for positive coverage or "pumping" a stock.

## 3. AI & Technology Usage
To maintain comprehensive coverage of the US Market, our editorial team utilizes advanced technology, including Artificial Intelligence (AI), to assist in data aggregation and initial drafting.
*   **Human Oversight:** Every article is reviewed, fact-checked, and edited by our human editorial staff before publication.
*   **Context:** AI is used as a research tool, not a replacement for human financial expertise and judgment.

## 4. Corrections Policy
We are committed to correcting errors promptly. If a factual error is identified (e.g., incorrect earnings per share data), we will update the article and append a correction note at the bottom of the page detailing the change and the date it was made.
