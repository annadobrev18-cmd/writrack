### Historical Context

The conflict between Israel and Hezbollah is not new, with the two sides having clashed multiple times in the past. However, the recent escalation has raised concerns over the potential for a wider conflict. In 2006, the two sides engaged in a 34-day war, which resulted in significant damage to Lebanon's infrastructure and economy.

### Financial Impact

The financial impact of the conflict is already being felt, with oil prices rising on concerns over regional stability. The price of Brent crude oil has increased by over 2% in the past week, while the price of West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude oil has risen by over 1.5%.

| Financial Metric | Current Value | Change |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Brent Crude Oil Price | $83.50/bbl | +2.1% |
| WTI Crude Oil Price | $78.20/bbl | +1.5% |
| S&P 500 Index | 4,100 | -0.5% |
| Nasdaq Composite Index | 14,500 | -0.8% |

The increase in oil prices has also led to a rise in the price of gold, which is often seen as a safe-haven asset during times of geopolitical uncertainty. The price of gold has risen by over 1% in the past week, reaching a high of $1,850/oz.
