The impact of AI on the job market has been a subject of debate, with some experts predicting significant job losses, while others argue that AI will create new job opportunities.

However, the same report also notes that up to 140 million new jobs could be created in the same period.

### Market Impact of AI Disruption
The market impact of AI disruption is already being felt, with some companies experiencing significant declines in their stock prices. The Jefferies study identified a basket of 15 stocks that are at high risk of being impacted by AI, including:

| Dropbox | Cloud Storage | 7/10 |
| Expedia | Travel Booking | 6.5/10 |
