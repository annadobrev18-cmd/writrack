## Walmart's Earnings and HSBC's Downgrade
Walmart, the world's largest retailer, has faced a significant downgrade from HSBC after its recent earnings report. The downgrade, which implies a 5% upside for Walmart's shares, has raised concerns among investors about the company's future prospects. In this analysis, we will delve into the details of Walmart's earnings, HSBC's downgrade, and the potential implications for investors.

### Walmart's Earnings Report
Walmart's earnings report revealed a mixed bag of results. While the company's revenue increased by 3.5% year-over-year, its net income declined by 10%.
