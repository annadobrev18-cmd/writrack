#### Financial Metrics
The following table compares the financial metrics of Nvidia and its competitors:
| Company | Market Capitalization | Revenue Growth | Net Income Margin |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Nvidia | $1.3 trillion | 50% | 25% |
| AMD | $200 billion | 20% | 10% |
| Intel | $300 billion | 10% | 15% |

### Expert Opinions
Morgan Stanley's analysts believe that Nvidia's strong growth potential is driven by its dominance in the gaming and artificial intelligence (AI) markets. The company's GPUs are widely used in gaming PCs and consoles, and its AI computing products are used in a variety of applications, including self-driving cars and natural language processing.

#### Growth Drivers

* Increasing demand for GPUs and AI computing products
