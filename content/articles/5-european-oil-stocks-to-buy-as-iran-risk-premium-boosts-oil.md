## Geopolitical Tensions and Oil Prices
The recent escalation of tensions between the US and Iran has led to a significant increase in oil prices, with the Brent crude oil price surpassing $80 per barrel. This surge in oil prices has created a favorable environment for oil stocks, particularly those in Europe. As the Iran risk premium continues to boost oil prices, investors are looking for opportunities to capitalize on this trend.

### Historical Context
The relationship between geopolitical tensions and oil prices is not new. In the past, conflicts in the Middle East have led to significant increases in oil prices, benefiting oil-producing countries and companies. The current situation is no exception, with the US-Iran tensions leading to a rise in oil prices. European oil stocks, in particular, are well-positioned to benefit from this trend, given their significant oil reserves and production capabilities.
