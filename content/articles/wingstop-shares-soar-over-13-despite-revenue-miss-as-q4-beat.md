## Wingstop's Q4 Earnings: A Mixed Bag
Wingstop's Q4 earnings report has sent shockwaves through the market, with the company's shares soaring over 13% despite a revenue miss. This unexpected turn of events has left many investors and analysts scratching their heads, wondering what drove this surge in stock price.

### Earnings Beat Expectations
The key takeaway from Wingstop's Q4 earnings report is that the company managed to beat earnings expectations, despite falling short on revenue. This is a testament to the company's ability to maintain profitability in the face of challenging market conditions.
