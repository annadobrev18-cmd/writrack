## Understanding Startup Failure
The failure of a startup can be a daunting experience for its employees. However, it's essential to recognize that such failures are an inherent part of the entrepreneurial ecosystem. The Wall Street Journal's recent article, 'The Startup Where You Worked Failed. Your Career Should Be Fine,' highlights the importance of career resilience in the face of startup failure.

### Historical Context of Startup Failure
Historically, startup failures have been more common than successes. According to CB Insights, the top reasons for startup failure include lack of market need, running out of cash, and not having the right team in place. These factors can be beyond the control of individual employees, emphasizing that startup failure does not define a professional's capabilities or potential.
