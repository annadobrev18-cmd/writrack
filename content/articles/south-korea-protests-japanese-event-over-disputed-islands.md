### Historical Context

The dispute over the islands dates back to the early 20th century, when Japan annexed the Korean peninsula. The islands were administered by Japan until the end of World War II, when they were returned to Korea. However, Japan has continued to claim sovereignty over the islands, citing historical and cultural ties.

The dispute has been a major point of tension between the two countries, with both sides engaging in diplomatic efforts to resolve the issue. In 2012, the South Korean president, Lee Myung-bak, visited the islands, sparking a strong reaction from Japan. Since then, the dispute has continued to simmer, with both countries engaging in a war of words and diplomatic maneuvers.

### Market Impact

The dispute over the islands has significant implications for the global economy, particularly in the areas of trade and investment. South Korea and Japan are two of the largest economies in the world, and any escalation of tensions between the two countries could have far-reaching consequences.

The dispute has already had an impact on trade between the two countries, with South Korea imposing sanctions on Japanese imports in response to Japan's claims over the islands. The sanctions have had a significant impact on Japanese businesses, particularly in the areas of electronics and automotive manufacturing.
