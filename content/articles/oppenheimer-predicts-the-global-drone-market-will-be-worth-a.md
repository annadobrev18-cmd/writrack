## Unmanned Aerial Systems: A Growing Market
The global drone market is expected to experience significant growth over the next decade, with Oppenheimer analysts predicting it will be worth $400 billion by 2036. This growth is driven by the increasing adoption of unmanned aerial systems (UAS) in various industries, including defense, commercial, and consumer markets.

### Historical Context
The use of drones in the defense sector is not new, with the first unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) being used in the 1990s for reconnaissance and surveillance missions. However, in recent years, the development and deployment of UAS have accelerated, with many countries investing heavily in drone technology. The global defense market has been growing steadily, but the 'lower-skies' category, which includes UAS, is growing twice as fast as the entire market.
