#### Financial Metrics
The following table highlights Verizon's financial metrics:
| Metric | 2022 | 2023 | 2024 |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Revenue | $133.6B | $136.4B | $140.1B |
| Net Income | $20.6B | $22.1B | $23.5B |
| EPS | $5.12 | $5.43 | $5.74 |
| Dividend Yield | 4.2% | 4.1% | 4.0% |

Verizon's financials demonstrate a consistent growth trend, with increasing revenue and net income over the past few years. The company's dividend yield is also attractive, providing a relatively stable source of income for investors.

### T-Mobile: A Challenger with Growth Potential
T-Mobile is another major telco company in the US, known for its innovative services and competitive pricing. The company has been expanding its customer base and improving its network infrastructure, making it a strong contender in the telco sector.

#### Financial Metrics
The following table highlights T-Mobile's financial metrics:
| Metric | 2022 | 2023 | 2024 |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Revenue | $79.6B | $84.2B | $89.1B |
| Net Income | $2.6B | $3.4B | $4.2B |
| EPS | $2.43 | $3.05 | $3.67 |
| Dividend Yield | 0.8% | 0.9% | 1.0% |

T-Mobile's financials show a significant growth trend, with increasing revenue and net income over the past few years. Although the company's dividend yield is lower than Verizon's, its growth potential makes it an attractive investment opportunity.

## Fed Implications and Sector Rotations
The current market volatility is largely driven by the Federal Reserve's monetary policy decisions. As the Fed continues to raise interest rates to combat inflation, investors are becoming increasingly cautious. However, the telco sector is less sensitive to interest rate changes, making it a relatively safe haven for investors.

### Sector Rotation
The following table highlights the sector rotation in the US stock market:
| Sector | 2022 | 2023 | 2024 |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Telco | 10.2% | 12.1% | 14.5% |
| Technology | 20.5% | 18.2% | 15.6% |
| Healthcare | 15.1% | 16.3% | 17.2% |
| Financials | 12.5% | 11.4% | 10.3% |

The telco sector has been gaining traction, with an increasing share of the US stock market. This trend is expected to continue, driven by the sector's stability and growth potential.

## Global Ripple Effects
The telco sector is not immune to global economic trends. The ongoing trade tensions and geopolitical uncertainties are affecting the global economy, leading to a decline in investor confidence.

### Global Telco Market
The following table highlights the global telco market:
| Region | 2022 | 2023 | 2024 |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| North America | 35.1% | 36.2% | 37.5% |
| Europe | 25.5% | 24.9% | 24.2% |
| Asia-Pacific | 30.4% | 31.4% | 32.5% |
| Latin America | 9.0% | 8.5% | 8.0% |

The global telco market is expected to continue growing, driven by increasing demand for mobile and broadband services. The Asia-Pacific region is expected to be a key driver of growth, with countries such as China and India investing heavily in their telco infrastructure.

## Peer Comparison

| Company | Market Capitalization | Revenue Growth | Net Income Growth |

| AT&T | $120B | 3.2% | 5.1% |
| Sprint | $20B | 2.5% | 3.5% |

Verizon and T-Mobile are well-established players in the telco sector, with strong financials and growth potential. While AT&T and Sprint are also major players, their growth trends are less impressive.
