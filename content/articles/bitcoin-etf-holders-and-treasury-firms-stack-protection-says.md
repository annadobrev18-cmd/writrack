## Bitcoin ETF Holders and Treasury Firms Stack Protection
The recent surge in Bitcoin's price has led to increased interest from institutional investors, with many seeking to protect their investments against potential price crashes. According to a report by Deribit, a cryptocurrency derivatives exchange, Bitcoin ETF holders and treasury firms have been stacking protection against a price crash below $60,000.

### Background
The Bitcoin price has been highly volatile in recent months, with prices fluctuating between $40,000 and $60,000. This volatility has led to increased demand for protection against potential price crashes, particularly among institutional investors. Bitcoin ETFs, which allow investors to gain exposure to Bitcoin without directly holding the asset, have become increasingly popular among institutional investors.

### Deribit's Report
Deribit's report highlights the increased demand for protection against a price crash below $60,000. The report notes that Bitcoin ETF holders and treasury firms have been buying put options, which give the holder the right to sell Bitcoin at a specified price (in this case, $60,000) before a certain date. This strategy allows investors to protect their investments against potential price crashes, while still maintaining exposure to the potential upside of Bitcoin.

#### Key Findings
The report highlights the following key findings:
* Increased demand for put options: Deribit has seen a significant increase in demand for put options, particularly among Bitcoin ETF holders and treasury firms.
* Protection against price crash: The majority of put options are being bought with a strike price of $60,000, indicating that investors are seeking to protect their investments against a price crash below this level.
* Institutional investor involvement: The report notes that institutional investors, including Bitcoin ETF holders and treasury firms, are driving the demand for put options.
