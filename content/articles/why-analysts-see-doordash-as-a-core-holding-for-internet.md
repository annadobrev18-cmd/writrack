## Fundamentals of DoorDash
DoorDash, a leading food delivery and logistics company, has been making waves in the stock market despite its recent fourth-quarter earnings miss. The company's strong fundamentals and growth potential have led many Wall Street analysts to retain their conviction, viewing DoorDash as a 'core holding' for internet investors.

### Historical Performance
Since its initial public offering (IPO) in 2020, DoorDash has demonstrated impressive growth, with its revenue increasing from $1.9 billion in 2020 to $6.8 billion in 2022. This significant growth can be attributed to the company's strategic expansion into new markets, both domestically and internationally, as well as its ability to adapt to changing consumer preferences.

The company generates revenue through commission fees on orders, as well as delivery fees. This model has proven to be highly scalable, allowing DoorDash to expand its operations rapidly while maintaining a strong profit margin.

## Valuation
Despite the recent earnings miss, DoorDash's valuation remains attractive to many investors. The company's price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio is currently around 10, which is lower than that of its peers in the food delivery industry.

| Company | Revenue (2022) | Net Income (2022) | P/E Ratio |

| Uber Eats | $8.3 billion | $-400 million | 15 |
| GrubHub | $2.3 billion | $-100 million | 12 |
