## The Allure of Dividend Aristocrats
In times of market volatility, investors often seek refuge in stocks that offer a consistent stream of income. Dividend aristocrats, a group of companies that have increased their dividend payouts for at least 25 consecutive years, have long been a favorite among investors looking for stable returns. However, the path to becoming a dividend aristocrat is not an easy one, and only a select few manage to achieve this prestigious status.

### Historical Context
The concept of dividend aristocrats was first introduced by S&P Dow Jones Indices in 2005. Since then, the list of dividend aristocrats has grown to include 65 companies, with household names such as Procter & Gamble, Coca-Cola, and Johnson & Johnson. These companies have demonstrated a commitment to returning value to shareholders through consistent dividend payments, even in times of economic downturn.
