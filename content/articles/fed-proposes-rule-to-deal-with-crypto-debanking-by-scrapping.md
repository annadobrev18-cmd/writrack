## Fed's Proposal: A Regulatory Shift
The Federal Reserve's recent proposal to scrap 'reputation risk' as a factor in determining whether banks can provide services to cryptocurrency companies marks a significant shift in the regulatory landscape. This move is expected to alleviate the issue of crypto debanking, where banks refuse to offer services to crypto businesses due to concerns over reputational damage.

### Historical Context: The Rise of Crypto Debanking
Crypto debanking has been a persistent issue for the digital asset industry, with many businesses struggling to access basic financial services such as bank accounts and payment processing. This has been largely due to banks' concerns over the perceived risks associated with cryptocurrency, including money laundering, terrorist financing, and market volatility. The lack of clear regulatory guidance has exacerbated the problem, leaving banks to navigate a complex and often contradictory landscape.
