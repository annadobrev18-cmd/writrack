### Valuation Metrics
To evaluate Walmart's stock, we must examine its valuation metrics. The company's price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio stands at 22.41, slightly above the industry average. However, its price-to-book (P/B) ratio is 4.33, indicating a relatively high valuation compared to its book value. The dividend yield is 1.95%, providing a moderate return for investors seeking regular income.

## Risk Factors and Challenges
Despite its strong fundamentals, Walmart faces several risk factors and challenges that could impact its stock performance.

### Competition from E-commerce Players
The rise of e-commerce giants like Amazon has forced traditional retailers to adapt and invest heavily in digital transformation. Walmart has responded by enhancing its online presence, but the competition remains fierce. The company must continue to innovate and improve its e-commerce capabilities to stay competitive.

### Supply Chain Disruptions
Global supply chain disruptions, exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic, have affected Walmart's operations. The company has implemented measures to mitigate these risks, including diversifying its supply chain and investing in logistics infrastructure. However, any future disruptions could impact its ability to maintain inventory levels and meet customer demand.

### Regulatory Environment
Changes in the regulatory environment, particularly with regards to tax policies and labor laws, could affect Walmart's profitability. The company must navigate these complexities and adapt to any changes in the regulatory landscape.
