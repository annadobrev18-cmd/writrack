## The Current State of Cruise Stocks
The cruise industry has been a topic of interest for investors in recent years, with the global pandemic having a significant impact on the sector. As the world returns to a sense of normalcy, cruise stocks have been gaining attention once again. One particular stock has caught the eye of analysts, with a potential 'cup-and-handle' chart pattern emerging.

### Historical Context of the Pattern
The 'cup-and-handle' pattern is a technical analysis chart pattern that resembles a cup with a handle. It is considered a bullish reversal pattern, indicating a potential uptrend in the stock price. This pattern is formed when a stock price falls, then rises to form the 'cup' shape, followed by a smaller decline, creating the 'handle'. The pattern is complete when the stock price breaks out above the resistance level formed by the top of the 'cup'.

#### Previous Instances of the Pattern
Looking back at historical data, we can see that the 'cup-and-handle' pattern has been a reliable indicator of future price movements. In 2020, the stock formed a similar pattern, which led to a significant increase in price over the next few months. This pattern has also been observed in other stocks within the industry, with similar results.
