## Nuclear Energy Stocks: A New Era of Growth
The nuclear energy sector has been gaining traction in recent years, driven by the increasing demand for clean and reliable energy sources. BWX Technologies, a leading provider of nuclear components and services, has been at the forefront of this trend. The company's recent earnings report has sparked a surge in its stock price, flashing a buy signal for investors.

### Historical Context: Nuclear Energy's Resurgence
The nuclear energy sector has experienced a significant resurgence in recent years, driven by the growing awareness of climate change and the need for low-carbon energy sources. The accident at the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant in 2011 led to a decline in the sector, but the industry has since rebounded, with many countries investing heavily in nuclear energy. The United States, in particular, has seen a significant increase in nuclear energy production, with the sector accounting for approximately 20% of the country's electricity generation.
