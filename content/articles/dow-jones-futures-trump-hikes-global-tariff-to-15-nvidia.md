## Dow Jones Futures: Trump Hikes Global Tariff To 15%
The Dow Jones futures have taken a significant hit as President Trump announces a hike in global tariffs to 15%. This move is expected to have far-reaching implications for the global economy, with many investors and analysts expressing concerns about the potential consequences.

### Historical Context
To understand the significance of this development, it's essential to look at the historical context of trade tensions between the US and other countries. The US-China trade war, which began in 2018, has been a major factor in the global economic slowdown. The imposition of tariffs on Chinese goods has led to retaliatory measures from China, affecting American businesses and consumers alike.

The current hike in global tariffs to 15% is a significant escalation of the trade tensions. This move is expected to affect not only China but also other countries that export goods to the US. The impact on the global economy could be substantial, with many experts predicting a slowdown in economic growth.

## Market Impact
The Dow Jones futures have already begun to feel the effects of the tariff hike, with a significant decline in the index. The market is expected to remain volatile in the coming days as investors and traders try to make sense of the new developments.

### Sector-wise Impact
The impact of the tariff hike will vary across different sectors. Some of the sectors that are expected to be affected the most include:

* Technology: The technology sector is expected to be hit hard by the tariff hike, particularly companies that rely on imports from China. Nvidia, which is set to release its earnings, could be one of the companies affected by the tariff hike.
* Automotive: The automotive sector is also expected to be impacted, with many car manufacturers relying on imports from China and other countries.
* Retail: The retail sector could also be affected, with many retailers relying on imports from China and other countries.

## Technical Analysis
From a technical perspective, the Dow Jones futures are looking bearish. The index has broken below its 50-day moving average, which is a significant support level. The relative strength index (RSI) is also indicating oversold conditions, which could lead to a bounce in the near term.

### Chart Patterns
The Dow Jones futures chart is showing a head and shoulders pattern, which is a bearish reversal pattern. The pattern is indicating a potential decline in the index, with the neckline of the pattern providing support.

## Expert Opinions

* **Goldman Sachs**: Goldman Sachs has downgraded its forecast for the US economy, citing the tariff hike as a major factor.
* **Morgan Stanley**: Morgan Stanley has also downgraded its forecast, predicting a significant slowdown in economic growth.
* **JP Morgan**: JP Morgan has warned that the tariff hike could lead to a recession, particularly if the trade tensions escalate further.
