## Supreme Court Decision on Trump's Tariffs: A New Era for Retail Stocks
The Supreme Court's recent decision to strike down some of Trump's tariffs has sent shockwaves through the retail industry, with several stocks poised to benefit from the ruling. According to Wells Fargo, Home Depot, Nike, and Target are among the top stocks that could rise in the wake of this decision.

### Historical Context: Trump's Tariffs and Their Impact on Retail
In 2018, the Trump administration imposed tariffs on various goods, including steel, aluminum, and Chinese imports. The move was aimed at protecting American industries and reducing the trade deficit. However, the tariffs had a significant impact on the retail sector, with many companies facing increased costs and reduced profit margins.

The tariffs also led to a trade war with China, resulting in retaliatory tariffs on American goods. The ongoing trade tensions had a negative impact on the global economy, with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) estimating that the tariffs could reduce global GDP by 0.8% by 2020.
