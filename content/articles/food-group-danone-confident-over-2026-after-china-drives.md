## Danone's 2025 Sales Beat: A Strong Finish to the Year
Danone, the French food group, has expressed confidence over its 2026 outlook after achieving a sales beat in 2025, largely driven by its performance in China. This positive momentum is a testament to the company's strategic efforts to expand its presence in emerging markets and diversify its product portfolio.

### Key Drivers of Danone's Sales Beat
The sales beat can be attributed to several key factors, including:
* Strong demand for Danone's dairy and plant-based products in China, where the company has been investing heavily in marketing and distribution efforts.
* The successful integration of recent acquisitions, such as the purchase of US-based plant-based food company, Follow Your Heart.
* A favorable pricing environment, which has allowed Danone to maintain its profit margins despite rising input costs.
