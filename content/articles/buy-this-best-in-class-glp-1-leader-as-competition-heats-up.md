## GLP-1 Market Overview
The GLP-1 (Glucagon-Like Peptide-1) receptor agonist market has been gaining significant attention in recent years, driven by the growing prevalence of diabetes and obesity. GLP-1 receptor agonists are a class of medications that mimic the action of the GLP-1 hormone, which helps to regulate blood sugar levels and appetite. The market is highly competitive, with several major pharmaceutical companies vying for market share.

### Historical Context
The GLP-1 market has experienced significant growth over the past decade, with the introduction of several new medications, including Victoza (liraglutide) and Trulicity (dulaglutide). These medications have been shown to be effective in improving glycemic control and reducing the risk of major adverse cardiovascular events. As a result, the market has expanded rapidly, with sales of GLP-1 receptor agonists reaching billions of dollars annually.
