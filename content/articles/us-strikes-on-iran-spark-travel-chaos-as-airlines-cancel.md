## US-Iran Conflict Sparks Travel Chaos
The recent US strikes on Iran have sent shockwaves through the global airline industry, sparking travel chaos as airlines scramble to cancel and reroute flights. The conflict has raised concerns over safety and geopolitical risk, prompting investors to reassess their portfolios and brace for potential losses.

### Historical Context: Airline Industry and Geopolitical Risk
The airline industry has long been vulnerable to geopolitical risk, with past conflicts and tensions impacting travel demand and airline operations. The 1990-1991 Gulf War, for example, led to a significant decline in air travel, while the 2010-2012 Arab Spring uprisings disrupted flights and affected airline profitability. The current US-Iran conflict is no exception, with airlines taking precautionary measures to ensure passenger safety.

### Market Impact: Airline Stocks and Oil Prices
The US-Iran conflict has had a significant impact on airline stocks, with many carriers experiencing a decline in share price. The increase in oil prices has also added to the industry's woes, as fuel costs account for a substantial portion of an airline's operating expenses. As of February 2026, the price of Brent crude oil has risen by over 10%, putting pressure on airline profitability.

| Airline | Share Price Change (Feb 2026) | Fuel Cost as % of Operating Expenses |
| --- | --- | --- |
| American Airlines | -8.5% | 25.6% |
| Delta Air Lines | -6.2% | 23.4% |
| United Airlines | -7.1% | 24.5% |
| Emirates | -10.3% | 30.1% |
| Qatar Airways | -9.5% | 28.2% |

### Technical Analysis: Airline Stocks and Oil Prices
From a technical analysis perspective, the airline stocks are facing significant resistance levels, with many carriers experiencing a decline in relative strength index (RSI) and moving average convergence divergence (MACD) indicators. The increase in oil prices has also led to a rise in the commodity's RSI, indicating overbought conditions.

#### Airline Stock Performance
The airline stocks have been underperforming the broader market, with many carriers experiencing a decline in share price. The Dow Jones US Airlines Index has fallen by over 12% since the start of 2026, underperforming the S&P 500 Index.

#### Oil Price Analysis
The price of Brent crude oil has risen by over 15% since the start of 2026, driven by concerns over supply disruptions and geopolitical risk. The oil price is facing significant resistance levels, with many technical analysts predicting a potential correction in the coming weeks.

## Expert Opinions: Assessing the Impact of US-Iran Conflict
The US-Iran conflict has sparked a range of opinions from industry experts, with many predicting a significant impact on the airline industry and global economy.

### Airline Industry Experts
According to airline industry experts, the conflict is likely to lead to a decline in air travel demand, particularly in the Middle East region. The increase in oil prices will also add to the industry's woes, as fuel costs account for a substantial portion of an airline's operating expenses.

### Geopolitical Risk Experts
Geopolitical risk experts predict that the conflict will lead to a rise in tensions between the US and Iran, potentially disrupting global supply chains and impacting trade. The increase in oil prices will also have a significant impact on the global economy, particularly in countries that are heavily reliant on oil imports.
