## The Demise of the 'Stablecoin Sandwich'
The 'stablecoin sandwich' model, which once dominated the crypto payments landscape, has become increasingly obsolete. This model relied on a complex system of intermediaries, with stablecoins acting as a bridge between traditional fiat currencies and cryptocurrencies. However, the inefficiencies and high transaction costs associated with this model have led to its decline.

### Historical Context
The rise of stablecoins was initially seen as a solution to the volatility of cryptocurrencies. By pegging their value to a stable asset, such as the US dollar, stablecoins aimed to provide a more reliable means of exchange. The 'stablecoin sandwich' model emerged as a way to facilitate transactions between different cryptocurrency platforms, using stablecoins as a intermediary. However, this model introduced additional layers of complexity, resulting in higher fees and slower transaction times.

## The Shift Towards User-Centricity
The next phase of stablecoin payments is all about the user relationship. By prioritizing user experience and building direct relationships with customers, crypto payment platforms can reduce intermediaries and increase efficiency. This shift is driven by the growing demand for seamless and cost-effective transactions.

### Market Impact
The move towards user-centricity is expected to have a significant impact on the crypto payments market. As platforms focus on building strong user relationships, we can expect to see:

* Increased adoption of crypto payments among mainstream users
* Improved transaction speeds and reduced fees
* Enhanced security and regulatory compliance

### Technical Analysis
From a technical perspective, the shift towards user-centricity will require significant advancements in areas such as:

* **Scalability**: Crypto payment platforms will need to develop more efficient and scalable architectures to support increased user adoption.
* **Interoperability**: Seamless interactions between different blockchain networks and traditional payment systems will be crucial for widespread adoption.
* **Security**: Enhanced security measures, such as multi-factor authentication and advanced encryption, will be necessary to protect user funds and prevent fraudulent activities.

#### Key Players
Some of the key players in the crypto payments space that are already embracing the user-centric model include:

| Platform | Description | Fees |
| --- | --- | --- |
| PayPal | Traditional payment platform with crypto capabilities | 2.9% + $0.30 per transaction |
| Coinbase | Crypto exchange with payment processing capabilities | 1.49% - 3.99% per transaction |
| BitPay | Crypto payment processor with merchant services | 1% per transaction |
