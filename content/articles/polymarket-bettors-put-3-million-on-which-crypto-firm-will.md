With over $3 million in bets placed, the platform has become a hub for speculation and prediction. The odds on each firm are constantly shifting, reflecting the market's perception of their likelihood of being exposed.

### Market Sentiment and Odds
The current odds on Polymarket reflect the market's sentiment on which firms are most likely to be exposed next. The table below shows the top 5 firms with the lowest odds, indicating a higher likelihood of being exposed:
