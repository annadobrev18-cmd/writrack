## Nvidia's Purchase Commitment: A Risky Affair
Michael Burry, a renowned investor, has drawn parallels between Nvidia's current surge in purchase obligations and Cisco's situation at the peak of the dot-com bubble. Burry's statement, 'This is not business as usual. This is risk,' highlights the potential dangers of Nvidia's aggressive expansion.

### Historical Context: Cisco and the Dot-Com Bubble
The dot-com bubble, which occurred in the late 1990s and early 2000s, was a period of extreme speculation and inflation in the technology sector. Cisco, a leading networking equipment manufacturer, was at the forefront of this bubble. The company's stock price skyrocketed, and its market capitalization reached unprecedented levels. However, when the bubble burst, Cisco's stock price plummeted, leaving many investors with significant losses.

### Nvidia's Current Situation
Nvidia, a leading manufacturer of graphics processing units (GPUs), has experienced a remarkable surge in its stock price over the past year. The company's purchase obligations have increased significantly, with many investors and analysts attributing this growth to the rising demand for AI-related technologies. However, Burry's warning suggests that Nvidia's aggressive expansion may be a sign of trouble ahead.

### Market Impact: A Comparison of Nvidia and Cisco
| Company | Market Capitalization (Peak) | Stock Price (Peak) | Purchase Obligations (Peak) |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Cisco (2000) | $555 Billion | $82.00 | $15.6 Billion |
| Nvidia (2026) | $1.2 Trillion | $1,200.00 | $20.8 Billion |

As shown in the table above, Nvidia's current market capitalization and stock price are significantly higher than Cisco's at the peak of the dot-com bubble. Additionally, Nvidia's purchase obligations have surpassed Cisco's peak levels. This raises concerns about the sustainability of Nvidia's growth and the potential risks associated with its aggressive expansion.

### Technical Analysis: Nvidia's Stock Price
Nvidia's stock price has been on a tear, with the company's shares increasing by over 50% in the past year. However, technical indicators suggest that the stock may be due for a correction. The relative strength index (RSI) is currently above 70, indicating overbought conditions. Additionally, the moving average convergence divergence (MACD) is showing signs of a potential bearish crossover.

#### Specific Data Points
* Nvidia's stock price has closed above its upper Bollinger Band for five consecutive days, a sign of extreme volatility.
* The company's short interest has decreased by 20% over the past month, indicating a potential lack of skepticism among investors.
* Nvidia's put-call ratio has fallen to a 12-month low, suggesting that investors are overly bullish on the stock.

### Expert Opinions: A Divergence of Views
While Burry's warning has sparked concerns about Nvidia's purchase obligations, other experts remain bullish on the company's prospects. Many analysts point to the growing demand for AI-related technologies and Nvidia's dominant position in the market. However, some experts have expressed concerns about the company's valuation, citing the potential for a correction in the stock price.

### Peer Comparison: Nvidia vs. AMD
Nvidia's main competitor, AMD, has also experienced significant growth in its stock price over the past year. However, AMD's purchase obligations are significantly lower than Nvidia's, and the company's valuation is more reasonable. This raises questions about the sustainability of Nvidia's growth and the potential risks associated with its aggressive expansion.

#### Detailed Comparison
| Company | Market Capitalization | Stock Price | Purchase Obligations | Valuation (P/E Ratio) |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Nvidia | $1.2 Trillion | $1,200.00 | $20.8 Billion | 50.2 |
| AMD | $200 Billion | $100.00 | $5.6 Billion | 30.1 |

As shown in the table above, Nvidia's market capitalization, stock price, and purchase obligations are significantly higher than AMD's. Additionally, Nvidia's valuation is more extreme, with a P/E ratio of 50.2 compared to AMD's 30.1.
