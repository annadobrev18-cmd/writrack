## Congressional Investment Trends: An Overview
The recent news of Rob Bresnahan, congressman of Pennsylvania's 8th district, engaging in substantial bond and treasury note purchases has sparked interest in the investment strategies of congressional members. As a seasoned financial analyst, it is essential to delve into the historical context of congressional investments, the current market impact, and the technical analysis of such investment decisions.

### Historical Context of Congressional Investments
Historically, congressional members have been known to invest in a variety of assets, including stocks, bonds, and real estate. However, the investment strategies of congressional members have come under scrutiny in recent years, with some critics arguing that they have access to insider information that can influence their investment decisions.
