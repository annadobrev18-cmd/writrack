### Historical Context: The Impact of Oil Prices on the Dow Jones

The relationship between oil prices and the Dow Jones is not new. In the past, we have seen that when oil prices rise, the Dow Jones tends to fall. This is because higher oil prices can lead to higher inflation, which can reduce consumer spending and, in turn, negatively impact the economy. For example, in 2008, when oil prices reached a record high of $147 per barrel, the Dow Jones fell by over 30%. Similarly, in 2014, when oil prices fell by over 50%, the Dow Jones rose by over 10%.

## Trump's Statement on Iran's New Leaders

Recently, President Trump stated that Iran's new leaders 'want to talk'. This statement has had a significant impact on the Dow Jones futures and oil prices. The reason for this is that a potential conflict between the US and Iran has been a major concern for investors in recent days. The conflict has the potential to disrupt oil supplies, which could lead to higher oil prices and, in turn, negatively impact the economy.

### Market Impact: The Effect of Trump's Statement on the Dow Jones and Oil Prices

The market impact of Trump's statement has been significant. The Dow Jones futures have risen, while oil prices have fallen. This is because investors believe that a potential conflict between the US and Iran is less likely, which reduces the risk of disrupted oil supplies. For example, on the day of Trump's statement, the Dow Jones futures rose by over 1%, while oil prices fell by over 2%.
