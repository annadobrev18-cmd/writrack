## The Rise of Prediction Markets
The concept of prediction markets has been around for decades, but it's only in recent years that they've started to gain mainstream traction. These markets, which allow users to bet on the outcome of various events, have grown from a niche interest to a $3 billion run rate, with some predictions suggesting they could reach a $10 billion future. This growth is not surprising, given the increasing popularity of cryptocurrency and blockchain technology, which have provided the infrastructure for these markets to flourish.

### Historical Context
To understand the significance of this growth, it's essential to look at the historical context of prediction markets. The first prediction market, the Iowa Electronic Markets, was launched in 1988 by the University of Iowa. However, it wasn't until the rise of cryptocurrency and blockchain that these markets started to gain popularity. The launch of platforms like Augur and Gnosis in 2018 marked a significant turning point, as they provided a decentralized and trustless way for users to participate in prediction markets.
