## Iran's Crypto Economy: An Overview
Iran's cryptocurrency market, valued at approximately $7.8 billion, has been thrust into the spotlight due to the ongoing crisis in the region. The country's crypto ecosystem, which includes a significant bitcoin mining network, has been growing rapidly in recent years. This growth can be attributed to the government's recognition of cryptocurrency mining as a legitimate industry in 2018.

### Historical Context
In 2018, the Iranian government officially recognized cryptocurrency mining as a legitimate industry, which led to a surge in mining activities in the country. The government's decision was motivated by the potential for cryptocurrency mining to generate revenue and create jobs. However, the industry has also been linked to money laundering and sanctions evasion.
