## The Emergence of the HALO Trade
The HALO trade, an acronym for 'Hefty Assets, Low Obsolescence,' has been gaining traction on Wall Street as investors seek to shield their portfolios from the impending disruption caused by artificial intelligence. This new trend involves bidding up companies that possess substantial real assets, such as grids, pipelines, and heavy machinery, which are less likely to be replaced by AI.

### Historical Context
The concept of investing in companies with tangible assets is not new. However, the HALO trade has gained significance in recent times, as the increasing adoption of AI technology has raised concerns about the potential obsolescence of certain industries. The HALO trade is an attempt to mitigate this risk by focusing on companies that own assets that are difficult to replicate or replace with AI.

### Market Impact
The HALO trade has already started to have a significant impact on the stock market. Companies that own real assets, such as utilities, pipelines, and industrial equipment manufacturers, have seen their stock prices surge in recent months. This trend is expected to continue, as more investors seek to diversify their portfolios and reduce their exposure to AI-related risks.

#### Key Players

## Technical Analysis
