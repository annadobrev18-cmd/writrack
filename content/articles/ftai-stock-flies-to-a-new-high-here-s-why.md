The aviation segment, in particular, has been a major driver of FTAI's success. The company has invested in a range of aviation assets, including aircraft, engines, and parts. This strategic move has enabled FTAI to capitalize on the growing demand for air travel and cargo transportation.

#### Key Financial Metrics
The following table highlights FTAI's key financial metrics:
| Metric | 2022 | 2023 | 2024 (Est.) |

| Net Income | $210M | $250M | $300M |
| EBITDA | $450M | $520M | $600M |
| Debt-to-Equity Ratio | 1.2 | 1.1 | 1.0 |

As shown in the table, FTAI's P/E ratio is slightly higher than its peers. However, this premium is justified by the company's strong growth prospects and diversified portfolio.
