The DAO was initially created in 2016 as a decentralized venture capital fund. It was built on the Ethereum blockchain and allowed investors to vote on which projects to fund. However, in June 2016, The DAO was hacked, resulting in the theft of approximately $50M worth of Ether. The hack was a major setback for The DAO and the Ethereum community as a whole.

### The Aftermath: A Hard Fork and a New Beginning

In response to the hack, the Ethereum community decided to hard fork the blockchain, creating a new version of the Ethereum network that reversed the effects of the hack. This move was controversial, with some members of the community opposing the hard fork and continuing to support the original blockchain, now known as Ethereum Classic.

### The DAO's Second Act: A Focus on Ethereum Security

Fast forward to 2026, and The DAO is back with a new focus on Ethereum security. The $150M endowment is a significant investment in the security of the Ethereum network. This move is a recognition of the importance of security in the blockchain and cryptocurrency space.
